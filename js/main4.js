// Overview
// Let's start out with something fun - a game!
//
// We'll be making Tic Tac Toe, a game that takes seconds to learn but minutes to master! Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges to get your feet wet in the world of web development.
//
// "hand me your phone," load up the game, and play a quick round!
//
// You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!
//
// What You've Learned
// By the time you submit this project, you will have covered new ground in many of the big themes of the course:
//
// Command Line: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
// Source Control: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
// Programming Fundamentals: Work with array, objects, event handlers & callbacks, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
// Web Fundamentals: Learn how communication happens over the internet, and how to structure, style, and animate documents within a browser. Also learn how to respond to actions taken by your users and the data they input into the browser.
// Browser Applications: Dive into CSS and learn how to use libraries and frameworks to get lots of style for free.
// Deployment: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment.
// Products and Teams: Document your code and your code repository so others understand what you've built.
// Big Goals
// Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
// Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
// Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
// Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
// Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
// Craft a readme.md file that explains your app to the world
// Technical Requirements
// Your app must:
//
// Render a game board in the browser
// Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select); your game should prevent users from playing a turn into a square that is already occupied
// Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
// Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
// Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
// Use Javascript with jQuery for DOM manipulation
// Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
// Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
// Bonus
// These are for extra credit! Don't focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.
//
// Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
// Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)
// Get inventive with your styling, e.g. use hover effects or animations to spiff things up
// Use LocalStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
// Support custom board sizes: default is 3x3 but you could allow users to choose a larger board
// Support networked multiplayer: https://www.firebase.com/ has a nice quickstart guide
// TRICKIEST: Create an AI opponent: teach Javascript to play an unbeatable game against you
// Start by implementing a few simple rules which can be easily checked and are always good moves, such as "always take the center square if it's available" - you can google these rules for yourself
// You can build in as many AI player rules as you like but you'll quickly end up with a longwinded list of if-else-if statements. To make a truly unbeatable AI opponent you'll need to look into implementing an algorithm like MiniMax - for advanced/bold students only!
